  <h2>🧠 What to Expect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Be ready to introduce yourself in a confident, positive way.</li>
    <li>Most employers ask about past experience, skills, and how you handle challenges.</li>
    <li>Be honest, but don't let your past define the conversation — highlight your growth, your work ethic, and what you bring to the table now.</li>
  </ul>

<div class="interview-section">
  <h2>❓ Common Interview Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>“Tell me about yourself.”</strong><br>
      Keep it short. Share your strengths, experience, and why you're excited to work.
    </li>
    <li><strong>“Why should we hire you?”</strong><br>
      Show your work ethic, reliability, and what makes you a strong teammate.</li>
    <li><strong>“Can you explain your gap in employment?”</strong><br>
      Be honest, take ownership, and show what you've learned or how you've grown.</li>
  </ul>
